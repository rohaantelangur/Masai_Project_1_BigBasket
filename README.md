This is our first project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We worked on bigbasket.com, an online food selling store.

We had a time frame of seven days. This was the first website building project for all of us, yes am emphasizing “website building” because we have built this website from scratch.

Home Page

We tried to give our website some common functionality such as Carousel Sliding, Tab Switching, Dropdown Menu, Hover Effects, On-scroll shrinking, Store/Brand pages, product pages, Cart pages, Payment pages, and most important Search filtering.

Shop page

We have tried to build the exact Navigation bar as has with the On-scroll size shrinking and the drop-down menu on-hover, and many other functions. We have built the exact footer as it is on the original website.

I worked on the home page, cart page & checkout page tried clone it exactly like the original website’s page specifically when it comes to the Navigation bar, footer, banners, and app download banner.
Worked on almost every page of the website in terms of syncing all the pages together and fixing the Navigation bar, footer sitemap, and as well as on functionality of the website.
Built product search filtering Created a local database for the search bar functionality And much other syncing functionality in this project was part of my job.
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap-5, Sweet alert, JS, and Local-Storage ( to store and get data) and creative tags in JavaScript.

I worked on the product page and cart page. I face some problems in the JavaScript part but it gets resolved by discussing them with my friends.
I learn a lot of things in JavaScript, learn more about local storage, how to append, add the product to the cart, make sliding and drop-down pages, and also improved my HTML & CSS, I like working as a team, interact with each other professionally.
I gave my best and did a lot of things but still, there are a few functionally things that are left behind and remain static. In my point of view, we can make our website more efficient by using JavaScript from the initial days so that we can save time unlike making pages again and again by using CSS and HTML so that we could have been worked more on the remaining things.

It was a great experience for me as this is my first project in tech. I
was very excited when we started working on the project. My team members
were very supportive and helped me a lot during project work.
I learned html, css, JS, DOM, and local storage in the second unit at masai school, so I use
that concept in this project. In this project specifically
I worked on product pages and the product desciption page. So, overall I get to know new concepts and I also learn how to work in a team.

I have used HTML, CSS to create a attractive webpage and with JS for all functionality.
My contribution in this project is about making few sections of segment bars which is common for all subpages.
By using CSS flex I have made content in alignment.
I have made a Carousel Slideshow by using Html, CSS and JS which I have learned from this project with help of my teammates.
